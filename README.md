1. A screen with a list of all available items
2. A screen with detailed infomation about each item
2. MainActivity must have a Floating Action Button that will open EditorActivity, where you can add new items to the inventory
3. App bar must be implemented using ToolBar
4. ToolBar in the MainActivity must have a menu with a button that deletes all the items in the inventory
5. ToolBar in the EditorActivity must have a menu with a button that deletes the current item from the list
6. When deleting one or all items, the app must show an AlertDialog asking if I'm sure I want to delete the item/items.
7. Use may allow main thread queries in Room
8. EditorActivity must have 2 modes: editor mode and creator mode
